The assessment is to build a simple REST service with two endpoints:
One endpoint to ingest an JSON object with the following format. Fields have length constraint on min/max, email is required and only one
of title and body is required.
{
 “id”: “123", - min 1, max 100
 “email”: “email@gmail.com”, - required
 “title”: “example”, - max 300
 “body”: “example” - max 10000
}
2. One endpoint to return this data, considering that the dataset will contain a large number of entries. Filtering should also be possible, by a
single field, one of id, email, title or body.The only constraint is that the project should be written in Java.
3. One endpoint that returns a CSV file that is a report on the ingested items, composed of two columns, the first one being the id of the item and
the second one being the amount of vowels contained in the body.
Feel free to use any libraries and/or frameworks you need!
When you’re finished, add it to a temporary Git repo and share it with us!
